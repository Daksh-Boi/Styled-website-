	<p > Dragon Ball Super is the third canonical installment of the dragon ball series with its prequels being dragon ball and dragon ball z. It takes place after the events of Z where in the end Goku and his friends defeat the evil Majin Buu. Now Goku is seen working as a farmer, and his family and friends live peacefully. However, the God of Destruction Beerus awakens after decades of slumber. Beerus, along with his Angel assistant and teacher, Whis, seeks a warrior known as the Super Saiyan God, threatening to destroy the Earth if he loses to him. Goku transforms into the Super Saiyan God with the help of his friends, battles Beerus and loses, but his efforts appease Beerus, who spares the planet. After saving Earth yet again, they z warriors have to fight the revived Frieza who comes to Earth with a new form called Golden Frieza which he attained after serious training. After defeating him, the z warriors are now introducted to Lord Champa which then leads to the rest of the events of shows like the universe 6 saga and the famous tournament of power arc.

	<p>Dragon Ball Super is a classic good anime according to me which has a lot of action packed episodes and very very good fights. Animation wise they have done a great job and the story though a bit different wasn't bad as the fights compensated for the plot and all the arcs were good. The pacing was also really well done.</p>
