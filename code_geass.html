	<p> In the year 2010, the Holy Empire of Britannia is establishing itself as a dominant military nation, starting with the conquest of Japan. Renamed to Area 11 after its swift defeat, Japan has seen significant resistance against these tyrants in an attempt to regain independence.Lelouch Lamperouge, a Britannian student, unfortunately finds himself caught in a crossfire between the Britannian and the Area 11 rebel armed forces. He is able to escape, however, thanks to the timely appearance of a mysterious girl named C.C., who bestows upon him Geass, the "Power of Kings." Realizing the vast potential of his newfound "power of absolute obedience," Lelouch embarks upon a perilous journey as the masked vigilante known as Zero, leading a merciless onslaught against Britannia in order to get revenge once and for all.

	<p>I think that anyone would enjoy hangyaku no lelouch the story and characters are amazing. I enjoyed it because of the amazing story and the art style which was also veryy good. Also if people are new to anime this is a good one to start with. I also enjoyed lelouch's  character development and how from being a selfish guy wanting only revenge he turned into a person who saves humanity by sacrificing himself and ending the cycle of hate in his world. One thing which I truly enjoyed was how smart lelouch was which is something you don't usually see in most anime protagonists out there. And the concept of injustice and racism is shown beautifully in this anime by using elevens(another name for the former Japanese people) which I really liked. </p>
