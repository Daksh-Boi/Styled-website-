	<p> Naruto is a show adapted from Masashi Kishimoto's manga of the same name. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. Naruto was not given any respect or love from the citizens of his village because he had the Nine Tales Fox sealed in him which was a demon which weaked havoc on the city 12 years before the present day situation. Now, after learning that he has the Nine Tales sealed in him, Naruto Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake. Like all the ninja teams from every village, Team 7 completes missions requested by the villagers, ranging from doing chores and being bodyguards to performing assassinations.Naruto becomes a ninja and joins with Sasuke Uchiha, against whom he often competes, and Sakura Haruno, on whom he has a crush, to form Team 7, under an experienced sensei, the elite ninja Kakashi Hatake.

	<p>For me this is more than just an Anime/Manga. This is one of the coolest, most powerfully inspirational story that I will probably ever know and love. This teaches great life lessons concerning perseverance, resilience, having kindness and a moral center not only relating to oneself but with others too, just profound in every sense. Especially with what it leads to. Plus lovable characters with awesomely epic action and ninja awesomeness that is too special to forget. I LOVE Naruto and will always continue doing that.
