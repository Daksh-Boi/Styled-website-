	<p> One piece is an anime adapeted form Eiichiro Oda's manga of the same name. It shows the adventure of the series's protagonist, Monkey D Luffy and his crew, the Straw Hats who are in their journey of finding the greatest treasure in the world called the One Piece.
	The series mainly focuses on Luffy, a young man made of rubber, whom, inspired by his childhood idol, the powerful pirate "Red Haired" Shanks, sets off on a journey from the East Blue Sea to find the mythical treasure, the One Piece, and proclaim himself the King of the Pirates. In an effort to organize his own crew, the Straw Hat Pirates, Luffy rescues and befriends a pirate hunter and swordsman named Roronoa Zoro, and they head off in search of the titular treasure. They are joined in their journey by Nami, a money-obsessed thief and navigator; Usopp, a sniper and compulsive liar; and Sanji, a perverted but chivalrous chef. They acquire a ship, the Going Merry, and engage in confrontations with notorious pirates of the East Blue. As Luffy and his crew set out on their adventures, others join the crew later in the series.

	<p  >One piece is a really good adventurous anime according to me which has a lot of funny episodes but also very very good fights and learnings too. Animation wise they did an okay job in the start but now their animation has gotten momentum and is really good. The story is one of the best I have ever seen and the worldbuilding of the anime isn't even comparable to any other I've ever seen.</p>
